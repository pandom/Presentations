# Sublime Text and DeckSet

- I have been writing markdown in my blogs for over 12 months

- It took a shift at first but has yielded efficiencies

- Deckset leverages my existing Markdown knowledge

---

#  ~~I don't have time to learn something extra~~ 
# Lies built on slander upon deceit

- Learning Markdown is simple

- It augments existing workflows

- Integrates into so many things

- A small payment of time now will be paid back tenfold

---

# Where do I start?

---

## Starting out

### DeckSet App has a free trial

- A markdown [Cheat sheet](http://decksetapp.com/cheatsheet/#text-styles) has DeckSet specifics

- Nearly all the markdown here complies with the defacto standard

- Standard markdown for everything else can be found at [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

# Okay, I get that it is easy. What about KeyNote and Powerpoint?

# Keynote and Powerpoint usage

- Keynote is simple to use. Clean and efficient and I use it for personal work collateral. I export this to PDF.

- Corporate standard is Powerpoint. I use this begrudgingly as they are highly animated, nauesous decks. VMworld decks are built with this for compatability with themes.

#[fit] So where do you 
#[fit]use MarkDown IRL Mr Burke?

#[fit] Where ever
#[fit] I
#[fit] Can

# Presenting code

Even code can be presented neatly - auto scaling too! Take that Powerpoint!

```python

## Create a variable of purge_firewall
def purge_firewall):
## Body == NONE due to this being a REST DELETE command.
    body = None
## Drawing on the httplib we use a HTTPS connection to the nsx_ip variable on the nsx_port variable
    conn = httplib.HTTPSConnectionnsx_ip, nsx_port)
## The actual secret sauce. Places the DELETE plus API call. Thanks to Andrew Babakian for noting my URI mixup and calling wrong due to library import.
    conn.request'DELETE','https://'+nsx_ip+'/api/4.0/firewall/globalroot-0/config', None, headers)
    response = conn.getresponse)
## if Response not equal to 204 then spit out bad response. Otherwise happy days.
    if response.status != 204:
        print "error status code",  strresponse.status) + " Firewall purge unsuccessful"
        return
    else:
        print "Status code", strresponse.status) + " Firewall purge successful"
        reset=True
        return
 
## Main funciton that calls purge_firewall into action. 
def main):
    purge_firewall)
    print "The deed has been done."
 
 ```
